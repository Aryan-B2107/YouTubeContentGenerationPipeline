How many of you...
0:04
...have a passion for going to the mountains?
0:05
Anyone who loves traveling to the hills?
0:07
You?
0:08
Where did this “hoo hoo” culture come from in our country?
0:11
This is not a part of our culture!
0:13
Has it ever happened in school that someone acted in a square play and went... ho... ho... ho?
0:17
Raise your hand and tell me.
0:19
How? Ma’am, how do you feel when you go to the mountains?
0:22
Very nice!
0:23
Anyone else who wants to share? Sir, you?
0:25
Who raised their hand?
0:25
No... no!
0:26
You did! Sir, how do you feel when you go to the hills?
0:28
It feels good!
0:29
Mostly... anyone else? Just one more person?
0:32
Peace... I mean most people are saying they find peace.
0:35
It feels good!
0:36
It feels peaceful! These people are fake!
0:41
They will never...this is AI!
0:46
I'm telling you the truth.
0:48
You only enjoy the mountains as long as you're sitting inside the car.
0:51
The moment you step out, you have to walk!
0:54
My friend and I, we live in Gurgaon.
0:56
We decided...
0:57
...that the land of Gurgaon is way too flat.
1:02
So why not go to the mountains for some adventure?
1:05
We are going out of Gurgaon in search of adventure—can you believe it?
1:08
Is Gurgaon lacking in adventure?
1:11
If I step out after 10 p.m.,
1:13
...even I feel like robbing someone!
1:16
There’s a vibe.
1:18
There’s an atmosphere in the air here!
1:21
You just feel it.
1:23
When you see someone walking on the other side of the road,
1:25
...you feel like smashing their head with a stone!
1:30
I’ve been mischievous since childhood!
1:33
I’ve always had a naughty nature.
1:35
Then people made me understand—it’s a crime!
1:38
You can’t do such things frequently!
1:41
I’m not able to follow my heart anymore!
1:43
I’ve heard that the local people in the hills...
1:45
...are very kind at heart, very good people!
1:47
We went to the mountains, and people were being rude to us!
1:50
They were asking for money at the Dharamshala.
1:52
We said, "Dharamshala?"
1:52
They said, "That’s the name of the place, bro—Dharamshala!"
1:58
The place we reached, the hotel’s name was Hyatt!
2:00
He was standing there, wrapped in a wet towel.
2:03
I said, “Tell me a good place to explore.”
2:05
If you ask about places to explore in the mountains, they immediately start talking about treks!
2:08
Like, “Go on this trek, you’ll go crazy!”
2:10
If I’ll go crazy, why would I even go?
2:14
You come back from there half-naked feeling good!
2:17
It was fun, man!
2:19
Nature is truly a wonderful thing!
2:21
Just one leaf wrapped around...
2:24
...and that too on the face!
2:27
Nature has driven me mad!
2:30
We had gone to McLeodganj.
2:33
And there, the Triund Trek is very famous!
2:36
You have to go there!
2:40
So he said, “Go to the Triund Trek!”
2:42
I asked, “What’s the Triund Trek like?”
2:43
He opened YouTube and started showing me, “This is the Triund Trek.
2:46
You’ll see it when you go!”
2:46
I said, “Well, now I’ve already seen it!”
2:52
You’re already looking crazy to me!
2:54
He said, “Bro, listen to me...
2:56
It’s my first day today.
2:58
The manager told me I can’t raise my hand on anyone today.
3:01
But I have one request.
3:03
When you check out tomorrow, don’t just leave...
3:04
Let’s meet before that!”
3:07
Man, I should’ve just knocked him out right there!
3:10
I said, “You idiot!
3:12
Just tell me a proper place to explore!”
3:15
He said, “There’s a trek about 8 kilometers from here.
3:17
Go there... there's a beautiful waterfall flowing.
3:19
There’s a lake, it’s lovely, you’ll have a great time! The path is scenic too!”
3:21
We both set off!
3:22
There were two paths to get there.
3:24
One easy path, the other — the path of death!
3:27
We looked into each other’s eyes...
3:29
And said, “We’re men, after all!”
3:32
Why would we choose the easy path?
3:34
Our brains are stuffed... with straw!
3:38
We must make full use of that straw!
3:41
We are men!
3:43
We’ll go down this path and get ourselves beaten up!
3:48
Both brave men started walking.
3:50
For the first half hour, when the path was smooth and nice...
3:53
...our friendship was going great!
3:56
We were hugging and all — “Bro, if you're here, I’m here too, man!”
4:00
The moment we started climbing uphill, irritation started kicking in!
4:04
“Bro, tell me one thing — are you stupid or what?”
4:09
Why did you bring me here?
4:11
“Dude, you were the one who said it!”
4:12
“So you’ll believe whatever I say?”
4:14
“When are you giving back my 5 rupees?!”
4:15
I’ll give it to you!
4:16
Give it now! — “I’ll give it, not right now!”
4:19
We were grabbing each other’s collars over there!
4:22
Then we calmed down a bit and walked further...
4:24
Suddenly we started hearing these “crack, snap...
4:27
...pop, crunch” sounds from around us!
4:29
When we paid attention, we realized it was coming from our own bodies!
4:37
Hips that had been jammed for years had finally opened up!
4:41
Our intestines had tied themselves in knots!
4:43
Our cholesterol was off the charts!
4:45
If someone had done a checkup then, we’d have tested positive for AIDS too!
4:50
I said...
4:51
“At this rate, we’re going to become martyrs!”
4:55
Let’s do one thing...
4:57
After every kilometer, let’s take a 4-hour nap!
5:03
He said, “Sounds good, O Lord!”
5:04
But over there, one kilometer was actually coming every 4 hours!
5:11
In our brains, there’s this hormone...
5:13
...called dopamine — it makes you feel happy.
5:14
That dopamine just died in agony right there!
5:19
We didn’t like anything anymore!
5:21
I really love dogs...
5:22
But when I saw a dog there, I freaked out!
5:25
Thinking it might bite me!
5:28
He said, “Bro, dogs bite, they don’t sting!”
5:30
I replied, “In the mountains, dogs are shapeshifters, bro!”
5:33
My brain was making up all kinds of imaginary stories!
5:36
Finally, we reached our destination...
5:39
...where they had claimed there’d be a waterfall!
5:42
There was no waterfall there!
5:45
There were just 3-4 little drains flowing from above...
5:47
...collecting into a pit below!
5:49
And the people there were running such a scam...
5:51
They were calling that pit a lake!
5:53
Imagine turning a pit into a lake!
5:54
We came all the way thinking we’d take a nice bath!
5:57
When we showed up, even the fish popped out...
5:59
...saying, “You guys go ahead first!”
6:01
“You’ve come from far, we live here!”
6:05
“There’s only enough water for one person at a time here!”
6:09
“Go ahead, bathe... why are you just standing there?”
6:12
“If you’ve got guts, go bathe and show us!”
6:14
“If your undies get fully soaked, let me know!”
6:18
“We’re not starting a family here... water is limited!”
6:21
“Useless people just show up from who knows where to bathe!”
6:28
I’m a shameless man...
6:30
...so I went ahead to bathe!
6:31
The water was weird — my stomach was wet, but my back stayed dry!
6:35
My friend was still sitting outside.
6:36
I said, “Come on bro, join me, have fun!”
6:37
He said, “No bro, you enjoy to the fullest!
6:40
Only you can bathe in such a trashy lake!”
6:43
“There’s barely any water here!”
6:44
“All the water splashed out because of your weight!”
6:48
“You’ve filled up another pit entirely!”
6:50
“Now they’ll promote even more tourism…”
6:52
…saying, ‘We’ve got two lakes now, come, come!’”
6:58
In that forest — where there are no animals, no humans...
7:01
...even there some guy was busy selling Maggi!
7:06
That guy...
7:07
Woh jungle mein mil jayenge apko!
7:09
...wearing a lungi, was grinding spices deep in the jungle!
7:11
He’s never even left the forest!
7:13
He knows he doesn’t have to go anywhere...
7:14
...because dimwits like us will come to him!
7:18
Feeding Maggi to humans by day, and catching deer by night!
7:22
If you wanna succeed in life — you must eat Maggi!
7:25
Why do you keep grazing like cows all day!
7:28
We said, “Let’s just go back, bro!”
7:30
There were two ways to return...
7:32
“One easy way, and one that leads to death!”
7:35
Humans learn from their mistakes...
7:38
...animals don’t.
7:41
Our bodies may have looked human...
7:43
...but our minds—
7:44
—were like that of an ox!
7:46
A man’s brain is basically like an ox’s brain!
7:49
We were still in that same attitude: “We’re men, bro!”
8:01
But this time...
8:03
...the confidence was kinda low.
8:05
Still trying to convince ourselves, “Bro, we’re men, right?”
8:11
My friend just went, “Ha ha ha ha!”
8:13
He was unconscious, remember?
8:15
He sat up suddenly, like, “We’re men, damn it!”
8:17
“We won’t take the easy path!
8:20
That’s where the girls go!”
8:22
That’s where the girls go!”
8:23
“This jungle route right here...
8:25
...we’ll go through this — with nature poking us from all sides!”
8:30
Taking in all the flora and fauna...
8:34
...and off we went — two brave 'men' on a mission!
8:36
My friend goes, “Wow...
8:38
I’m healing with nature!
8:41
All my life problems — gone!”
8:44
I was like, “Bro, how is nature curing your piles though?!”
8:50
I pulled out the map to check...
8:52
It showed the path was just 45 minutes long.
8:55
After walking for 45 minutes straight, I checked again...
8:58
...now it said 55 minutes to go!
9:02
What kind of route is this, man?
9:04
Did we accidentally take the path to salvation?!
9:08
Look, I’m an educated man — I don’t believe in ghosts or spirits...
9:11
...at least not until it gets dark!
9:15
But the moment it gets dark, you do start to believe in ghosts!
9:19
Look, ghosts might be real... or not.
9:21
But witches — they definitely exist!
9:26
Because all these spirits and ghosts — they’re all from our own society, man!
9:29
Even up there, women are dominating us!
9:34
Like that one witch yelling at her ghost husband: “Sit down quietly!”
9:38
“I’m not crazy, okay?
9:39
I’ve been putting nail polish on backward feet for the last half hour!
9:43
And instead of helping me, you’re showing me attitude?! GET LOST!”
9:48
The human mind is so f***ed up!
9:51
Just look at the crap we talk during the day...
9:54
...stuff that makes zero sense!
9:55
And as soon as night falls, we start ghost talk automatically!
9:59
Like, “Even if I get scared sh*tless... my swag won’t die!”
10:03
During the day we’re saying stuff like: “Bro...
10:05
This food reminded me of my mom!
10:08
She used to cook horribly too!”
10:13
I mean, she loved us a lot — just couldn’t cook to save her life!
10:17
But at night...
10:19
...our whole conversation flips into:
10:21
“Bro, you know what?
10:23
There was this witch in my village...
10:25
Every time my grandpa stepped out...
10:27
Every time my grandpa stepped out...
10:28
And she’d call out his name, like ‘Grandpa ji!’”
10:32
Thing is... his actual name was Grandpa Ji!
10:35
And the moment he turned around... she’d vanish!
10:38
I mean... is the witch trying to scare him, or is she scared herself? No clue!
10:41
Forget the witch — tell me more about Grandpa Ji!
10:44
Like, what did his face look like, man?!
10:48
…whose face is so scary that even the witch is freaking out!
10:53
It’s getting darker and darker — the situation is going downhill!
10:55
The path was supposed to be 45 minutes long...
10:56
But these two “men” have been stuck for more than 2.5 hours!
10:59
And now the men are feeling cold!
11:01
Suddenly, my friend starts staring at me!
11:04
Just staring... continuously.
11:05
I said, “Bro… bro… listen to me!”
11:07
“I’m committed!”
11:13
He goes, “You’re misunderstanding me...
11:15
…I just want to kiss you!”
11:19
I said, “This is not okay!”
11:20
He said, “This is friendship!”
11:21
I said, “Bro, this is not friendship!”
11:23
He said, “We’ve known each other for so many years…
11:25
…we’re a little comfortable with each other…”
11:25
I said, “No bro!”
11:27
He said, “Just on the surface, man!”
11:28
I said, “No dude!”
11:33
I mean, I told him I’m committed...
11:35
…I’m seeing another guy!
11:40
This was around 4–5 years ago...
11:42
I had gone to the village — I was gay for a few days!
11:47
At that time, everyone in my village was gay!
11:49
Actually, they weren’t gay...
11:51
…they had come from the city.
11:52
They thought LGBT was the name of some course!
11:55
...a course that helped you land a job faster!
11:57
So they opened an institute there:
11:59
“LGBT C++ Java Python!”
12:02
I didn’t know much back then!
12:05
I honestly didn’t know!
12:07
Later, when I moved out...
12:08
…to big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune...
12:10
…that’s when I realized...
12:11
“Ohhh! Guys can marry guys now too!
12:14
Society has changed!”
12:16
So I went back into my closet!
12:19
So I tried to explain to my friend, “Bro…
12:23
…I can’t do this.
12:27
I’m just not into that stuff...
12:30
...and 800 rupees is way too low!”
12:39
Right then, we saw a guy coming towards us on a bike.
12:42
I was like, “Thank God, someone’s here!
12:43
We stepped out in the morning like men...
12:46
...and by night, we were fully vulnerable!”
12:51
Just get us out of here somehow!
12:53
Then my friend started staring at me again!
12:55
He said, “Bro, tell me one thing — you were just rejecting me a while ago!
12:59
But now you're straight up negotiating deals with some random guy!”
13:02
I said, “Listen, man...
13:05
...transactions happen in cash too!
13:08
Not everywhere supports GPay, okay?”
13:15
That man said, “Bro, I would’ve given you guys a lift...
13:18
...but your conversation has shaken me to my core!”
13:23
“So no, I’m not giving you a ride — not even on the back seat!
13:27
I’m outta here!”
13:28
I said, “No problem, bro…
13:30
…but before you leave, at least tell us —
13:31
…are we on the right path? We’re heading to McLeodganj, right?”
13:33
He said, “McLeodganj is 15 kilometers behind you!
13:36
Keep going this way and you’ll end up in Israel!”
13:41
I said, “Bro, this much adventure wasn’t part of the plan!”
13:43
He said, “Don’t worry, guys...
13:45
Just keep walking calmly — the jungle is safe!
13:47
Sometimes you might see a tiger or bear…”
13:49
“What?! There are tigers and bears here?!”
13:50
My friend said, “Bro, I was about to go to the washroom...
13:53
…but I already went!”
13:56
He said, “You guys are overthinking...
13:58
Just keep talking to each other — the tiger won’t come near you!”
14:02
“Bro, what kinda solution is that?
14:04
Keep talking and the tiger won’t come?”
14:06
Like the tiger’s sitting there listening to us!
14:08
‘Let them finish — two people are having a chat…
14:10
…seems like they’re solving some personal stuff…
14:13
…go ahead, go ahead, finish your talk!’”
14:16
Keep talking and the tiger won’t come, huh?!
14:19
And if the tiger does come… should we start a conversation with him?
14:22
Like, “Hey tiger…
14:24
…bro, your physique is amazing!”
14:27
“You got tattoos too?”
14:28
“Oh really, that’s natural? I had no idea!”
14:31
“I’m from a village — didn’t know much, honestly.”
14:33
“And tiger...
14:34
...did you eat mutton today?”
14:36
"Alright then, tiger... I’m leaving now, okay?"
14:39
“I’m heading out, tiger, I really am!”
14:42
“Let go of my thigh, man!”
14:45
“You’ve got it clamped between your teeth!”
14:47
“You’ve torn through 1.5 kilos of my mutton!”
14:50
“Just let go, and I’ll quietly leave!”
14:55
Look, friends, I’m telling you — I’ve got no problem with tigers.
14:57
Because the moment a tiger shows up in front of you, you don’t have to do anything!
15:00
Whatever needs to be done — the tiger will handle it!
15:02
You don’t need to play the hero everywhere!
15:03
Sometimes you just gotta accept death, man!
15:06
But the good thing about tigers is —
15:07
They kill quick — as soon as they catch you, it’s over. No delays.
15:10
Doesn’t take much time at all.
15:12
But bears… now that’s another story.
15:14
I don’t know how much you all know about wildlife...
15:17
…but bears are not okay!
15:21
Bears are not okay!
15:24
Bears are ill-mannered!
15:26
Bears are morally corrupt!
15:30
Their character is just not right!
15:33
Bears like to play… okay?
15:36
…and they have no gender preferences! Like zero!
15:39
No he, no she — just “de-dadaam!”
15:47
I don’t even know how to explain this to you people!
15:50
Even I don’t feel comfortable...
15:52
...talking about it, but facts are facts!
15:55
A bear — before killing — beats the crap out of you!
16:02
And that kind of death...
16:04
Nobody wants that!
16:06
But let me honestly say something about myself —
16:08
I’m scared only of death!
16:11
Nothing else really scares me.
16:14
I don’t care that much about honor and dignity and all that!
16:17
If something bad happens — no big deal!
16:20
All I care about is... I wanna stay alive, that’s it!
16:22
And I’m not gonna tell anyone about it later!
16:25
You’re the one who’s gonna go around sharing your trauma with everyone...
16:28
...and that’s when you’ll be humiliated... by a bear!
16:28
“Heh heh… by a bear!”
16:32
Your respect is in your hands, bro!
16:35
I just wanna stay alive!
16:37
What happens in the jungle, stays in the jungle!
16:40
I’ll walk outta there, no shame at all, bear!
16:43
It’s all good, bear!
16:46
You just did what you thought was right, didn’t you?
16:49
I used to be a nature lover, man!
16:52
Turns out... even nature loved me back!
17:01
Friends, incidents like these are quite common in the forests.
17:04
And when such things happen,
17:06
a sense of depression starts to build up in our minds.
17:10
We need to come together to overcome this feeling of sadness.
17:13
That’s why I’ve organized live shows,
17:16
both in India and abroad.
17:18
